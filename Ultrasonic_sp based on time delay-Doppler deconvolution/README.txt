The R-L deconvolution algorithm was derived from Bayes' theorem by Richardson and Lucy in the early 1970s. Currently, the R-L deconvolution algorithm is mainly used in the fields of image deblurring and image restoration, and is based on Bayesian estimation and gradually improves the estimation of the image through an iterative process.
The sampling mutual ambiguity function contains the ambiguity of the transmit signal, and the reflectivity density function contains the time delay and Doppler frequency shift information of the echo signal, so it is necessary to estimate the reflectivity density function of the target. The auto-ambiguity function of the transmit signal can be obtained by the measurement method, and the sampling cross-ambiguity function can be calculated based on the echo signal and the transmit signal. By deconvolution of the sampling cross-ambiguity function, the ambiguity of the transmitted signal can be eliminated and the reflectivity density function can be estimated. This deconvolution method solves the problem that the resolution of delay and Doppler is limited by the width of the main flap of the auto-ambiguity function, and thus improves the resolution of delay and Doppler parameters of the target by the ultrasound imaging system.
